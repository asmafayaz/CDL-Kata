CDL Kata JavaScript Exercise - CDL Global 

-Keep your solution simple, making effective use of your chosen language.

I used JavaScript rather than React or React native was because I was more familiar and had more experience with JavaScript. Also, my development environment was already set up for this.

-Do provide some tests, especially around the most important logic.

I did tests for the checkout and stock keeping and for the orders as well. I did tests on billing. 

-Tell us about key decisions you made and what you'd do if you had more time.

I created the app.js where the application is created and initialized. I added an order.js in order to have a function running the management of the application. For example, checking the stock and the price and if it is on discount.
Then I decided I need to know the result of adding the price of a product in combination with a discount and these details shown through the billing.js. I then just about added a function for overseeing the stock. For example the amount of stock, type of stock. I added an Index.html to display how it works.

If I had more time I would have liked to add a carrier bag function and tests to go with it. A function that a carrier bag is needed in order to submit an order, the amount of carrier bags depending on the items that are ordered. Also, to also the customer to find out how much a bag carries. In addition, being able to create rules for discount items and the order limit for it.
